# WeatherApp - AuraAlert

**AuraAlert** is a web application that allows users to check current and forecasted weather data for selected locations. It is written in Python using the Flask framework, along with libraries such as SQLAlchemy, matplotlib, and the OpenWeatherMap API for retrieving weather data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used to build the application.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the application.
- **SQLAlchemy**: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for database management.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Used to fetch weather and air quality data.
- **Matplotlib**: A library for creating charts and data visualizations.

## Features

AuraAlert provides a range of features:

- **Weather Data**: View current and forecasted weather information for various locations.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate visual charts of weather trends for selected cities.
- **Database Integration**: Efficient management of weather data using SQLAlchemy.

### Recommended Test Cities

When testing chart generation, we recommend using one of the following cities, as the database contains the most entries for these locations:

- Toru≈Ñ
- Katar
- Bydgoszcz
